# INTRO-TO-PYTHON

What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

Installing Python:
You can download Python from the official website (python.org) and install it on your system.
Python is available for multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Running Python Code:
Python code can be executed in two ways: interactively through the Python interpreter prompt and by running Python scripts.
To run code interactively, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type python to start the Python interpreter.
To execute Python scripts, you can save your code in a file with a .py extension and run it using the python command followed by the file name.

Basic Syntax:
Python uses indentation to define code blocks, rather than using braces {} like many other programming languages.
Statements in Python are typically ended with a newline character. However, you can use a semicolon ; to separate multiple statements on the same line.

Python is case-sensitive.
Data Types:
Python supports several data types including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.
Variables in Python do not require explicit declaration. You can directly assign a value to a variable.

Control Structures:
Python provides control structures like if, else, elif, for, while to control the flow of execution in your program.
The if statement is used for conditional execution based on whether a certain expression evaluates to True or False.
Loops such as for and while are used for iterating over sequences and performing repetitive tasks.

Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters.
You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses containing the arguments.
Python functions can return values using the return statement.
Modules and Packages:
Python modules are files containing Python code, which can define functions, classes, and variables.
Packages are directories containing multiple modules and a special __init__.py file.
You can import modules and packages using the import statement.

Comments:
Comments in Python start with the # symbol and extend to the end of the line. They are used to add explanations or annotations to the code.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Python supports object-oriented programming paradigm.
Classes and objects are the key concepts of OOP in Python.
You can define classes using the class keyword and create objects (instances) of those classes.
